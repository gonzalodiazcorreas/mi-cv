Hi there! As you may have seen, I’m Gonzalo, an urban planner and urban data scientist based in Barcelona since 2021.

I hold a degree in Architecture from the Madrid School of Architecture (ETSAM) and a Professional Master’s degree from the Barcelona School of Architecture (ETSAB), where I also began my academic path in Urbanism through the Advanced Master’s Degree in Architecture. This training has allowed me to build a solid foundation at the intersection of architectural design, urban theory, and data-driven analysis.

I consider myself deeply passionate about architecture and the city, and I strongly believe in the collective capacity and responsibility to shape our territories in more inclusive, resilient, and meaningful ways. I am motivated by collaboration, curiosity, and the idea that thoughtful urban design and analysis can contribute to improving everyday life and expanding opportunities for everyone.

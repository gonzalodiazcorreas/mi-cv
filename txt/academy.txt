My academic background is primarily oriented toward research, developed through my degree and master’s theses, as well as through research work carried out at trescientosmil and independent personal research initiatives.

My personal research has focused on urban morphology and public space, exploring how spatial configurations influence urban life and regeneration processes. This work has been presented at international conferences such as IFoU Lisbon and ISUF Turin.

My Master’s thesis investigates the relationship between urban morphology and regeneration projects, with the aim of understanding how different spatial structures condition the development, intensity, and outcomes of regeneration interventions.

My Bachelor’s thesis examines the relationship between cities and food systems, focusing on their integration into urban and logistical systems. The research explores alternative models for implementing more sustainable, resilient, and locally embedded urban food systems.

My professional career has developed across several complementary areas that closely reflect my current interests.

My main focus has been urban planning, a field in which I have been working at trescientosmil since 2023. In this role, I have managed and contributed to both national and international projects, engaging with a wide range of scales and contexts. This experience has strengthened my ability to work collaboratively, address complex urban challenges, and translate strategic visions into concrete planning proposals.

In parallel, I have gained experience in building rehabilitation and interior design through my work at architecture and interior design firms, as well as through internships undertaken since 2019. These roles have provided me with a strong understanding of architectural detail, constructive processes, and the relationship between design decisions and everyday use of space.
